/**
 * <p>
 * This package is basically for block extended classes. Since newer versions of forge
 * the block constructor is now public instead of protected.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The syntax as follows
 * <blockquote>
 * 	<code>public static final Block <i>BLOCK</i> = new Block();</code>
 * </blockquote>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The block needs to have a model, a blockstate, a texture, and an item model
